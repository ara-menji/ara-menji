## About Me 
As an aspiring data science student, I am highly motivated to apply my skills in statistics, programming, and problem-solving to real-world problems. I have a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, and I am constantly learning new tools and techniques to expand my abilities. I am passionate about using data to drive decision-making and to uncover insights that can lead to positive change.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages, including Python, R, and SQL, as well as a number of data analysis and visualization libraries. I have also taken courses in machine learning, deep learning, and big data processing, and I am eager to continue building my skills in these areas.

In addition to my technical abilities, I am a strong collaborator and communicator, with experience working in both individual and team settings. I am excited to work with others to tackle challenging problems and to apply my skills to make a meaningful impact.

I am currently seeking opportunities to work on projects and gain experience in data science, and I would love to contribute to open-source projects on Github.
